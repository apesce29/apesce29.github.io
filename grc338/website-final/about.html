                        Welcome to Crust & Crumb, a family-owned pie shop where every recipe is steeped in history and love. Our story began with Great Grandma Jane, a spirited baker whose kitchen was always filled with the comforting aroma of freshly baked pies. Her secret recipes, passed down through generations, are the heart and soul of everything we make.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At Crust & Crumb, we carry on Jane's legacy by crafting pies that bring people together. Each crust is handmade daily—flaky, golden, and perfectly crumbly—just as she taught us. Our fillings are made from the finest, freshest ingredients, ensuring every bite bursts with authentic, homemade flavor.
                    </p>

                        From classic sweet treats like Apple and Lemon Meringue to savory favorites like Chicken Pot Pie and Shepherd’s Pie, our menu reflects a timeless dedication to quality and creativity. We’ve also expanded our offerings to include a variety of vegan options, honoring our commitment to making everyone feel at home at our table.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For us, Crust & Crumb isn’t just a business—it’s a labor of love and a tribute to the woman who inspired it all. Whether you’re stopping by to share a slice with family, picking up a pie for a special occasion, or just treating yourself, we’re here to make your day a little sweeter and more delicious.
